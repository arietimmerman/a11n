# Identity Solution Architecture

A good architecture is characterized is durable, useful and beautiful. An identity solution architecture should not focus on issues of the past, but even more so on challenges to come.

Many identity solution architectures focus on security. Of cousrse this is a major component and understandable because identity projects are often compliancy driven. Yet, proper security is never reached without putting user experience in the center.

If you cannot use an identity solution frictionless, it is doomed to fail in the near future. People - dedicated to fulfill the job the best they can - will work around non user friendly security measures.

The security department should never act as a business prevention department. On the contrary! It should equipre the organizations with proper breaks so it can drive even faster.

Examples of solutions that - when implemented correctly - improve both security and user experience are single-sign on, automatic application account and access provisioning, passwordless authentication, and push-and-swipe access request approvals.
